    <h1>Introduction to Spellbooks</h1>
    <p>There are only a few things that I have found truly can destroy a man’s soul:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The loss of a child.</li>
        <li>The loss of your wife.</li>
        <li>The thought of what you could have been, what you can be, and what you currently are.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The first two, I have no advice – only God can help you there.</p>
    <p>As far as the third goes, we must establish some fundamental rules:</p>
    <h2>Fundamental Rules</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Your life in the Materium (physical space) matters.</strong> What you do, create, think, touch, see, hear, eat, move, AFFECT – MATTERS. This will not be a discussion as to why. You can choose to explain it to yourself from a pious lens, spiritually, logically; I don’t really care how you convince yourself. If you must convince yourself by some mental gymnastics, then you are weak, cowardly, and should CHOOSE to no longer need this mental pampering. You are a serious man, made of the Lord; act accordingly.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Without this belief in yourself, in your ultimate true self, you will never achieve the far reaches of mastery while maintaining joy. Notice, I didn’t say either isn’t achievable without the other, but both together is impossible without these laws.</p>

    <h2>Factors of Learning</h2>
    <p>ACTION, SPELLBOOKS, TIME, MONEY.</p>

    <h2>Nomenclature</h2>
    <h3>Spell(s) and SpellChain</h3>
    <p>A specific topic or outcome you wish to pursue, often a very small branch of a large set. Think “I want to learn naturopathy → I want to learn about naturopathy medicines → I want to learn about digestion issues through naturopathy → I want to learn about the exact herbs used for parasitic digestion infestation through the lens of naturopathy → I want to learn about the one specific ingredient in relation to the parasitic digestion issue through the lens of naturopathy.” The first part is a big spell; as we go down, they turn into micro spells, all of which will be necessary to execute the big spell. Multiple spells make a SpellChain. Multiple SpellChains create a MasteryChain.</p>

    <h3>MasteryChain</h3>
    <p>The ultimate form of wizardry. Think of it like becoming the Tom Brady of Quarterbacks. The Napoleon of military conquest. The Ernst Rüdin of eugenics. You
